# Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis
Google Data Analytics Capstone Case Study
Objective
I analyzed historical Cyclistic bike-share data to understand how casual riders and annual members use bikes differently and to develop data-driven marketing strategies to convert casual riders into annual members.
Data
•	Source: Divvy bike-share data (Motivate International Inc.)
•	Timeframe: Q1 2019 & Q1 2020
•	Total Records (Post-Cleaning): 785,390
•	Tools: R (tidyverse, lubridate), Tableau, Excel
Key Findings
•	Casual riders take trips 3× longer than members (38.3 vs. 11.4 minutes)
•	Members ride primarily on weekdays during commute hours
•	Casual riders peak on weekends and afternoons
•	Casual riders favor tourist and leisure stations, members favor transit hubs
Recommendations
•	Introduce weekend-only or seasonal memberships
•	Promote annual membership as cost-effective for longer rides
•	Target digital ads at leisure stations during peak casual hours
Skills Demonstrated
Data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory analysis, visualization, and business-driven storytelling.
